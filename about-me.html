        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Vimal Vinod as you have probably surmised from this website. I am currently in college at Miami
          University in Oxford, OH where I am a sophomore studying software engineering. I have a passion for all things
          related to computers and software and hope to someday translate that passion into something more practicable
          as soon as I can. Along with my interest in computers, I also have a love for books and photography. Please
          take time to explore this website as it will highlight all of the aspects of myself which I am the most proud
          of.</p>

        <h2>In Najran</h2>
        <p>I was originally born in the city of Najran in Saudi Arabia on January 11, 2002. It is very close to the a
          border with the nearby country of Yemen and I do not remember much about it. Some of the few memories I do
          have from this part of my life included riding on my father's shoulders as we walked along a long highway
          filled with tall skyscrapers on either side and of playing with my many toys in our small but cozy apartment.
          The city of Najran, however, is apparently extremely ancient with evidence of settlement dating back as far as
          4000 years ago. The image to the left shows an example of a traditional fort made of mud brick construction
          found within the city. </p>

        <h2>In Kerala</h2>
        <p>After leaving Najran at the age of 4, I came back to my parent's home in India, specifically in the state of
          Kerala. Kerala is located on the southern tip of India and is basically the opposite of the desert which I was
          born in. Whether it be running around with my friends through the small village I lived in or exploring the
          woods which seemingly surrounded it, I spent the next few years of my life enjoying everything this new and
          exciting place had to offer. The image to the left shows a boat house which many tourists use when exploring
          the many rivers and backwaters of the state.</p>

        <h2>In the US</h2>
        <p>After 3 years of living in India, my parents got jobs in the US which meant that I would be moving again. For
          the next 9 years or so, I would live in the same place in Baltimore, Maryland before moving once more to
          Newtown, Pennsylvania for high school and then once more to Oxford, Ohio for college where I am now. The image
          to the left shows me cuddling with my brother shortly after moving to the US. </p>
